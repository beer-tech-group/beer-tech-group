I have 6 years of experience in designing mobile apps and websites, and I am currently working with Angelini Consumer to create services for families. Throughout my career, I have worked on big European projects, primarily in the health and business innovation sectors. This has given me a deep understanding of customer and consumer needs, and helped me find creative and innovative solutions to meet them.
