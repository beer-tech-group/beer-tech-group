Android developer by day, sofa tester by night. 

I've been releasing bugs into production since 2014, but now I'm working as an Android Platform Engineer and faking my knowledge of Gradle and Android Tooling.

In my spare time, I am a leisure champion, a powerlifter, a former Kung-Fu and Capoeira practitioner, a cook, and, most importantly, a budding pizza chef.
