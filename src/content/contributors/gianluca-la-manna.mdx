As a kid, I was curious how an on-screen Donkey Kong could move in any direction I wanted, just via a joypad. So over time I tried to understand what was behind that world. In general it was about programming and it was there that I became so passionate that I undertook both high school and university studies in computer science. Over time I also became interested in the development of microcontrollers, so much so that I presented something for my degree thesis. Today my career has given way to a frontend development path.

I'm curious about the news and above all the methodologies for producing quality software.
When I'm not riding my Harley, you can find me making some beer recipes, or at least I'm trying :)

I like to read, especially topics concerning personal growth.
