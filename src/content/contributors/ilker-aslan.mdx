Each day tries to discover the dark side of the mobile development, and tries to create something meaningful for the users. Cares about clickable text buttons, testable logic, human readable code, scalable systems, and sharing the suffering he had while learning with others. Likes declarable UI paradigm with shared code. In his free time, he creates yet another open source side project to try cool things.
