Sometimes it happens I work on Android apps, but mainly I just press random buttons on the keyboard.
I've been working on Android for little more than 8 years, currently I work for Subito in different areas, such as, for example, making sure that you see advertisements (you love them, don't you?).
My hobbies are making games that I don't complete, sitting on my sofa a.k.a. "Fausto-holder", watching interesting and fun YouTube videos and, of course, going to the gym to scale down my beer belly.
